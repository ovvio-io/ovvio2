/**
 * Here you'll find a convenience implementation of Non-Preemptive Multitasking
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking aka Coroutines.
 *
 * At the heart of a coroutine sits a Generator, which is the native mechanism
 * for voluntarily jumping between execution contexts. A generator is then
 * wrapped by a Coroutine instance which manages its thread-like state of
 * executing. It also exposes itself as a Promise which further simplifies
 * real world interactions.
 *
 * Finally the CoroutineScheduler manages a pool of concurrently running
 * coroutines. Every event loop cycle the scheduler executes some coroutines
 * while watching the clock. After kSchedulerCycleTimeMs it'll stop execution
 * and return control to the browser's event loop. This has the apparent effect
 * of threads running concurrently to the main UI thread in a true shared memory
 * model.
